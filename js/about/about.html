    <p>Hello! Welcome to my website. I'm Alexandra Polubiec, but you can call me Alex, or Allie.</p>
    <p>I'm a JavaScript software engineer, with a background documenting programming languages and APIs for network technology startups.</p>
    <p>I love learning new things, working on challenging projects, playing with code, and making beautiful things. I enjoy APIs, network protocols, and web security, and also telling really nerdy jokes</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include: euro-style board games, video games, singing, piano, learning new things, and hobbies (seriously, I seem to be collecting hobbies!)</p>
    <p>Feel free send me an <a href="mailto:alex@polubiec.com">email</a>, check out my <a href="http://paloobi.tumblr.com">Blog</a>, or just browse around my site!</p>
