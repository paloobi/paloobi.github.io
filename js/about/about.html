      <p>I build full stack JavaScript web applications. I also enjoy programming in Python and Ruby, and I'm currently learning React.</p>
      <p>I have a solid foundation in network technology and web application deployment considerations from my background documenting enterprise network products for network engineers and application developers. I can configure a Virtual Server in order to balance traffic between real servers, I can define terms like Network Address Translation, and I can explain the difference between TLS and SSL.</p>
      <p>When I'm not programming, I like to make music, draw pictures, and write stories. And also play lots of board games.</p>
